For this task, I downloaded the file from Trello and put it in the folder Github_task.
To upload it to the repository, I opened Gitbash in the folder. Then I used git init to initialise the repository. Then I saw the status using git status and it showed another unadded file in the folder. Then I used git add with the address of the Employee file.
Then I committed the file using git commit -m "employee added". Then I used git remote origin master with the link of the repository to set up a remote repository. Then I used git pull origin master to pull the changes in the repository.
Then I used git push origin master to push the changes to the repository.
