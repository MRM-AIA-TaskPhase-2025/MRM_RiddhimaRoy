First to make the file, I opened command prompt and entered mkdir Github_task. To navigate inside the folder, I used cd Github_task.
Then to form the file, I used echo print("Hello World!") > hello_world.py and the file wanted was formed.

To upload it to the repository on github. I opened the folder with the file in it and opened GitBash by right-clicking.
Then to initialise the repository, I used git init.
Then I used git add -A to add the file. Then I used git commit -m "commit 1" to commit the file to the repository.
Then I used git remote origin master followed by the link of the repository found under Code.
Then I used git push origin master. Then I opened github and saw the command and pull request notification. Then I went to settings and changed the default branch to master from main and the file showed on my repository.
